# about me

Greetings, I’m Joseph John-Karl Workman. Born 22/10/1984 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.

Please, just call me Joseph or Jo or anything really. Just don't forget to call me when there is food to be eaten.

I’m a human being.

I live in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

I am a fan of humanity and want us to survive.

I am a REALLY big fan of the future generations of humanity and I want to leave them a better world.

I'm interested in education, programming, governing, business, technology, entrepreneurship, music and lots of other things.
