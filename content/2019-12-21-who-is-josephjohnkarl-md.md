Greetings, I’m Joseph John-Karl Workman. Born 22/10/1984 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.



Please, just call me Joseph or Jo or anything really. Just don't forget to call me when there is food to be eaten.



I’m a human being.



I live in Grand Rapids, Michigan.



I am a fan of humanity and want us to survive.



I am a REALLY big fan of the future generations of humanity and I want to leave them a better world.



I'm interested in education, programming, governing, business, technology, entrepreneurship, music and lots of other things.
